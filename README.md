# Project 2. Movie Mania

This is an Interactive Full-Stack Application.

## Application concept:

- As a user, I want to make a web application which allows a user to browse movies using movie api and view details about the movie.

- The USER creates an account providing a NAME, an EMAIL, and a PASSWORD.

- The USER can then LOG IN with the correct CREDENTIALS.

- THE USER will then be taken to a HOME PAGE with a SEARCH area.

  a. The HOME PAGE consists of MOVIE POSTERS that the USER has FAVORITED.

  b. THE SEARCH area has BUTTONS that correspond to specific GENRES.

  b-1. The BUTTONS each take the USER to the specified GENRE.

  b-2. The SEARCH area has an input field for the USER to search for a MOVIE TITLE.

- Upon clicking a GENRE or searching a MOVIE TITLE the page is populated with MOVIES based on the USER'S REQUEST.

- The USER is given the capability of saving the MOVIES to their FAVORITES by clicking the HEART at the bottom of the MOVIE CARDS.

- Should the USER not find a MOVIE that they want to FAVORITE, they may return HOME by clicking the 'HOME' ICON in the Upper Right and SEARCH AGAIN.

- The USER can click on a POSTER and be taken to a page with DETAILS about the MOVIE such as a DESCRIPTION and CRITIC REVIEWS.

- The USER will still be able to FAVORITE the MOVIE on this page.

- When the USER is finished FAVORITING MOVIES they may RETURN HOME to view all of their FAVORITES.

- If the USER does not want to risk their FAVORITES being changed by someone else, then the USER should click 'LOG OUT' in the Upper Right.
